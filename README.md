# servoProject
this project is simulator project to controlling in tow servos with variable resistor. it is done via **tinkercad** simulator 

### Tools
This projet use the following simulation tools:
* Ardino UNO R3  1
* Potentiometer  2
* Micro servo    2
### Function
The `map()` function in this project is used for remaps numbers from one range to another.

The **syntax is **  `map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh);`
